number four, Privet Drive, \nwere proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \nthank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d \nexpect to be involved in anything strange or \nmysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such \nnonsense. \n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \nGrunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \nman with hardly any neck, although he did have a \nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and \nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \nneck, which came in very useful as she spent so \nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying \non the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son \ncalled Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \nboy anywhere. \n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \nalso had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \nsomebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they \ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. \nMrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t \n\nPage | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended \nshe didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her \ngood-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \nwas possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think \nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \nthe street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. \n\nThis boy was another good reason for keeping the \nPotters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a \nchild like that. \n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \nTuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \nmysterious things would soon be happening all over \nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out \nhis most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \nDudley into his high chair. \n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \nthe window. \n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his \nbriefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and \ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \ncereal at the walls. \u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley \nas he left the house. He got into his car and backed \nout of number four\u2019s drive. \n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \nfirst sign of something peculiar \u2014 a cat reading a \nmap. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he \nhad seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look \nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \nof Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What \ncould he have been thinking of? It must have been a \ntrick of the light.

As he sat in the usual \nmorning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that \nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear \npeople who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups \nyou saw on young people! He supposed this was some \nstupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the \nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \nexcitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \nthat a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that \nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an \nemerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it \nstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \nstunt \u2014 these people were obviously collecting for \nsomething ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \non and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in \nhis office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might \nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that \nmorning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in \nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did; \nthey pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an \nowl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \ndifferent people. He made several important telephone \nPage | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\ncalls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \nmood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch \nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \nbun from the bakery. \n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \npassed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed \nthem angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but \nthey made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering \nexcitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting \ntin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a \nlarge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \nof what they were saying. \n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2014 \u201d \n\n\u201c \u2014 yes, their son, Harry \u2014 \u201d \n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead.

It was a few seconds before Mr. \nDursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \ncloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost \nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split \ninto a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \nmade passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, \nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \nKnow-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \nday!\u201d \n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \nmiddle and walked off. \n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been \nhugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he \nhad been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was \nrattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, \nhoping he was imagining things, which he had never \nhoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of \nimagination. \n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \nfirst thing he saw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 \nwas the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was \nnow sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the \nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly. \n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. \n\nWas this normal cat behavior?

After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t \nhave a sister. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \n\u201cOwls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \nfunny-looking people in town today ...\u201d \n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n\n\u201cWell, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \ndo with ... you know ... her crowd.\u201d \n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. \nDursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d \nheard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. \nInstead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014 \nhe\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again?

Mrs. Dursley fell asleep \nquickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \nin his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell \nasleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \nthere was no reason for them to come near him and \nMrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \nPetunia thought about them and their kind. ... He \ncouldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up \nin anything that might be going on \u2014 he yawned and \nturned over \u2014 it couldn\u2019t affect them. ... \n\nHow very wrong he was. \n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \nsign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, \nits eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \nDrive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door \nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls \nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \nbefore the cat moved at all. \n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been \nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d \nhave thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The \ncat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet \nDrive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \nsilver of his hair and beard, which were both long \n\nPage | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nenough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long \nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, \nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \nand his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \nhad been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was \nAlbus Dumbledore. \n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had \njust arrived in a street where everything from his \nname to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy \nrummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But \nhe did seem to realize he was being watched, because \nhe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For \nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \nhim. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have \nknown.\u201d \n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside \npocket.

She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \nHer black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She \nlooked distinctly ruffled. \n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all \nday,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \n\n\u201cAll day?

It was a very \nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It \nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though, \nbecause he put it back in his pocket and said, \n\u201cHagrid\u2019s late.

Rowling \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE VANASHIG GLASS \n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had \nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \nPrivet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose \non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \nnumber four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into \ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same \nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had \nseen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the \nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been \nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \nball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley \nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the \nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \ngame with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \nmother. The room held no sign at all that another boy \nlived in the house, too. \n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \nbut not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it \n\n\n\nPage | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nwas her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \nday. \n\n\u201cUp! Get up!

Harry \nwas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \nPage | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the \nkitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all \nDudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though \nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not \nto mention the second television and the racing bike. \nExactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a \nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated \nexercise \u2014 unless of course it involved punching \nsomebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, \nbut he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, \nbut he was very fast. \n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \ncupboard, but Harry had always been small and \nskinny for his age. He looked even smaller and \nskinnier than he really was because all he had to \nwear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was \nabout four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin \nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \neyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot \nof Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had \npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He \nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the \nfirst question he could ever remember asking his \nAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had \nsaid. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t ask questions \u2014 that was the first rule for a \nquiet life with the Dursleys. \n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was \nturning over the bacon. \n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning \ngreeting. \n\nPage | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

The Dursleys bought Dudley \n\nPage | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were \nall big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and \nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of \nthem were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite \nsport: Harry Hunting. \n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible \nout of the house, wandering around and thinking \nabout the end of the holidays, where he could see a \ntiny ray of hope.

Her lips \ntightened as they always did if he dared to ask a \nquestion. \n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said. \n\nHarry looked in the bowl again. \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing \nsome of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just \nlike everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d \n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not \nto argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to \nthink about how he was going to look on his first day \nat Stonewall High \u2014 like he was wearing bits of old \nelephant skin, probably. \n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with \nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new \nuniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as \nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which \nhe carried everywhere, on the table. \n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters \non the doormat. \n\nPage | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

It \nonly took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything \nhe owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat \ndown on the bed and stared around him. Nearly \neverything in here was broken. The month-old video \ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank \nDudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s \ndog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first-ever television \nset, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite \nprogram had been canceled; there was a large \nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley \nhad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was \nup on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley \nhad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They \nwere the only things in the room that looked as \nthough they\u2019d never been touched. \n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling \nat his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there ... I need \nthat room ... make him get out. ...\u201d \n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday \nhe\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d \nrather be back in his cupboard with that letter than \nup here without it. \n\nPage | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. \nDudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his \nfather with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, \nkicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through \nthe greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room \nback. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday \nand bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. \nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each \nother darkly. \n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to \nbe trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get \nit.

Exactly what he was \nlooking for, none of them knew. He drove them into \nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook \nhis head, got back in the car, and off they went again. \nThe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed \nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the \ntop of a multilevel parking garage. \n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt \nPetunia dully late that afternoon.

Icy sea spray and rain \ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped \ntheir faces. After what seemed like hours they \nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and \nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of \nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the \nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. \nThere were only two rooms. \n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips \neach and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the \nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said \ncheerfully. \n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought \nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a \nstorm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though \nthe thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all. \n\nPage | 48 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around \nthem. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls \nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy \nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in \nthe second room and made up a bed for Dudley on \nthe moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off \nto the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find \nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under \nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket. \n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the \nnight went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and \nturned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach \nrumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned \nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. \nThe lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was \ndangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told \nHarry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time.

He was holding a rifle in \nhis hands \u2014 now they knew what had been in the \nlong, thin package he had brought with them. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you \u2014 I\u2019m armed!\u201d \n\nThere was a pause. Then \u2014 \n\nSMASH! \n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean \noff its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat \non the floor. \n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway.

The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. \nHe turned to look at them all. \n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh?

He meant to say thank \nyou, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, \nand what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\nThe giant chuckled. \n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself.

Although \nHagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was \nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary \nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats \nwere too small and the trains too slow. \n\nPage | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

They \npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger \nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as \nif it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an \nordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there \nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath \nthem? Were there really shops that sold spell books \nand broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge \njoke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t \nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he \nmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though \neverything Hagrid had told him so far was \nunbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him. \n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky \nCauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d \n\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t \npointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was \nthere. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their \neyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the \nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the \nLeaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most \npeculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. \nBefore he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him \ninside. \n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A \nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny \nglasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long \npipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old \nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a \ntoothless walnut.

Rowling \n\n\n\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that \ntowered over the other little shops. Standing beside \nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of \nscarlet and gold, was \u2014 \n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they \nwalked up the white stone steps toward him. The \ngoblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a \nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry \nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they \nwalked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of \ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon \nthem: \n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed \n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed, \n\nFor those who take, but do not earn, \n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn. \n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors \n\nA treasure that was never yours, \n\nThief, you have been warned, beware \n\nOf finding more than treasure there. \n\n\u201cLike I said, yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said \nHagrid. \n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors \nand they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred \nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long \ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in \nbrass scales, examining precious stones through \neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count \nPage | 81 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nleading off the hall, and yet more goblins were \nshowing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry \nmade for the counter. \n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come \nter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d \n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started \nemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a \nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of \nnumbers.

Once Hagrid had \ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, \nhe and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the \ndoors leading off the hall. \n\n\n\nPage | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred \nand thirteen?\u201d Harry asked. \n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery \nsecret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. \nMore\u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d \n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who \nhad expected more marble, was surprised. They were \nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming \ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were \nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled \nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward \nthem. They climbed in \u2014 Hagrid with some difficulty \n\u2014 and were off. \n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting \npassages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, \nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The \nrattling cart seemed to know its own way, because \nGriphook wasn\u2019t steering. \n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, \nbut he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw \na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted \naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late \u2014 they \nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake \nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the \nceiling and floor. \n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise \nof the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a \nstalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d \n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 \nask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be \nsick.\u201d \n\n\n\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at \nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid \ngot out and had to lean against the wall to stop his \nknees from trembling. \n\nGriphook unlocked the door.

And all the time \nthere had been a small fortune belonging to him, \nburied deep under London. \n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \n\n\u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine \nKnuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough.

I hate them \nGringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry \nentered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous. \n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all \nin mauve. \n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to \nspeak. \u201cGot the lot here \u2014 another young man being \nfitted up just now, in fact.\u201d \n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed \nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch \npinned up his long black robes.

Even Dudley, \nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get \nhis hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to \ndrag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses \n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies \nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, \nTongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor \nVindictus Viridian. \n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter \nuse magic in the Muggle world except in very special \ncircumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh \ncouldn\u2019 work any of them curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot \nmore study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d \n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, \neither (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice \nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a \ncollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the \nApothecary, which was fascinating enough to make \nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and \nrotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the \nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders \nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, \nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While \nHagrid asked the man behind the counter for a \nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, \nHarry himself examined silver unicorn horns at \ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- \nblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \n\n\n\nPage | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

He couldn\u2019t stop \nstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor \nQuirrell. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect \nyou\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.

Peeling gold \nletters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine \nWands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded \npurple cushion in the dusty window. \n\n\n\nPage | 91 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the \nshop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, \nempty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid \nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had \nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new \nquestions that had just occurred to him and looked \ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly \nright up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of \nhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here \nseemed to tingle with some secret magic. \n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. \nHagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a \nloud crunching noise and he got quickly off the \nspindly chair. \n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale \neyes shining like moons through the gloom of the \nshop. \n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly. \n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be \nseeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \n\u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes.

Up another escalator, out into \nPaddington station; Harry only realized where they \nwere when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he \nsaid. \n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on \nplastic seats to eat them.

Half terrified, half furious, they \nacted as though any chair with Harry in it were \nempty. Although this was an improvement in many \nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. \n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for \ncompany. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name \nhe had found in A History of Magic. His school books \nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late \ninto the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt \nPetunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because \nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night \nbefore he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day \n\n\n\nPage | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\non the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, \ncounting down to September the first. \n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better \nspeak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s \nCross station the next day, so he went down to the \nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on \ntelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he \nwas there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the \nroom. \n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Uncle Vernon?\u201d \n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to \u2014 to \ngo to Hogwarts.\u201d \n\nUncle Vernon grunted again. \n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d \n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d \n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon \nactually spoke. \n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. \nMagic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d \n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything. \n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first \ntime.

We\u2019re going up to London \ntomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying \nto keep things friendly. \n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle \nVernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before \nhe goes to Smeltings.\u201d \n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was \ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up \nand pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to \nwalk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes \u2014 he\u2019d \nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet \nagain to make sure he had everything he needed, saw \nthat Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then \npaced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. \nTwo hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been \nloaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had \ntalked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had \nset off. \n\n\n\nPage | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle \nVernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and \nwheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this \nwas strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, \nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine \u2014 platform \nten. Your platform should be somewhere in the \nmiddle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do \nthey?\u201d \n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic \nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic \nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, \nnothing at all. \n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even \nnastier smile. He left without another word. Harry \nturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of \nthem were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. \nWhat on earth was he going to do? He was starting to \nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d \nhave to ask someone. \n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention \nplatform nine and three-quarters. The guard had \nnever heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t \neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he \nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being \nstupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for \nthe train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said \nthere wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, \nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying \nhard not to panic.

He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, \nnot even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home \nto the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his \nteachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. \nAny second now, Professor McGonagall would come \nback and lead him to his doom. \n\nThen something happened that made him jump about \na foot in the air \u2014 several people behind him \nscreamed. \n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d \n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About \ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back \nwall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they \nglided across the room talking to one another and \nhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be \narguing. What looked like a fat little monk was \nsaying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give \nhim a second chance \u2014 \u201d \n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the \nchances he deserves?

One by one, the \nghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first \nyears, \u201cand follow me.\u201d \n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, \nHarry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with \nRon behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, \nback across the hall, and through a pair of double \ndoors into the Great Hall. \n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and \nsplendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands \nof candles that were floating in midair over four long \ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates \nand goblets. At the top of the hall was another long \ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor \nMcGonagall led the first years up here, so that they \nPage | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students, \nwith the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces \nstaring at them looked like pale lanterns in the \nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among \nthe students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to \navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and \nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard \nHermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky \noutside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d \n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, \nand that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the \nheavens. \n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor \nMcGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front \nof the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed \nwizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and \nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in \nthe house. \n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry \nthought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing \u2014 \nnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at \nthe hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there \nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip \nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth \u2014 and the \nhat began to sing: \n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty, \n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see, \n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find \n\nA smarter hat than me. \n\nYou can keep your bowlers black, \n\n\n\nPage | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

It bowed to each of the four tables and then \nbecame quite still again. \n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to \nHarry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling \na troll.\u201d \n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot \nbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish they \ncould have tried it on without everyone watching. The \nhat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel \nbrave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If \nonly the hat had mentioned a House for people who \nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for \nhim. \n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a \nlong roll of parchment. \n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and \nsit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott, \nHannah!\u201d \n\n\n\nPage | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

The ghost patted his arm, giving \nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it \ninto a bucket of ice-cold water. \n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end \nnearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave \nhim the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, \nin the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, \nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once \nfrom the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on \nthe train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing \nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. \nHarry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous \nyoung man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking \nvery peculiar in a large purple turban. \n\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted. \n\u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a Black boy even taller than Ron, \njoined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d \nbecame a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn.

He had never seen so many \nthings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast \nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, \nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \nfries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, \nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint \nhumbugs. \n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but \nhe\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. \nDudley had always taken anything that Harry really \nwanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate \nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and \nbegan to eat. It was all delicious. \n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, \nwatching Harry cut up his steak. \n\nPage | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Professor \nMcGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it \nhadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of \nhomework the day before. \n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to \nthis by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on \nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had \nsuddenly streamed into the Great Hall during \nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their \nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto their \nlaps. \n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She \nsometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of \ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the \nother school owls. This morning, however, she \nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry \ntore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \n\n\n\nPage | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nDear Harry, \n\n\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like \nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three? \n\nI want to hear all about your first week.

By the end of \nthe first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. \nSnape didn\u2019t dislike Harry \u2014 he hated him. \n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the \ndungeons.

He was just telling everyone \nto look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his \nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a \nloud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow \nmanaged to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted \nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone \nfloor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within \nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools \nwhile Neville, who had been drenched in the potion \nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as \nangry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion \naway with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you \nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron \noff the fire?\u201d \n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over \nhis nose. \n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at \nSeamus.

Hams and pheasants \nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was \n\nPage | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as \nfierce as he looked. \n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring \nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock \ncakes onto a plate. \n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s \nfreckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers \naway from the forest.\u201d \n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins \nthat almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron \npretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all \nabout their first lessons.

It was \na cutting from the Daily Prophet : \n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \n\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts \non 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark \nwizards or witches unknown. \n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had \nbeen taken.

It might\u2019ve been happening \nwhile we were there!\u201d \n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t \nmeet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered \nhim another rock cake. Harry read the story again. \n\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven \nPage | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling \n\n\n\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He \ncomplained loudly about first years never getting on \nthe House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful \nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly \nescaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only \none, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d \nspent most of his childhood zooming around the \ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell \nanyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a \nhang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from \nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. \nRon had already had a big argument with Dean \nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. \nRon couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with \nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry \nhad caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham \nsoccer team, trying to make the players move. \n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, \nbecause his grandmother had never let him near one. \nPrivately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because \nNeville managed to have an extraordinary number of \naccidents even with both feet on the ground. \n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about \nflying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t \nlearn by heart out of a book \u2014 not that she hadn\u2019t \ntried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all \nstupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library \nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was \nhanging on to her every word, desperate for anything \nthat might help him hang on to his broomstick later, \nbut everybody else was very pleased when Hermione \u2019s \nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, \nsomething that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of \ncourse. Malfoy \u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him \n\n\n\nPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Harry \nhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about \nthe school brooms, saying that some of them started \nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly \nto the left. \n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, \ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \n\u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick.

Hermione Granger\u2019s had \nsimply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t \nmoved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell \nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a \nquaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that \nhe wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their \nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up \nand down the rows correcting their grips.

All they really wanted \nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their \ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail \nabout a week later. \n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, \neveryone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long, \nthin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry \nwas just as interested as everyone else to see what \nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the \nowls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, \nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly \nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a \nletter on top of the parcel. \n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, \nbecause it said: \n\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I \ndon\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a \nbroomstick or they\u2019ll all want one.

There are \nseven players on each side. Three of them are called \nChasers.\u201d \n\n\n\nPage | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a \nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe \nChasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and \nget it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten \npoints every time the Quaffle goes through one of the \nhoops. Follow me?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through \nthe hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo \u2014 that\u2019s sort of \nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t \nit?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously. \n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly. \n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called \nthe Keeper \u2014 I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly \naround our hoops and stop the other team from \nscoring.\u201d \n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was \ndetermined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with \nthe Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He \npointed at the three balls left inside the box. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d \n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short \nbaseball bat. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood \nsaid. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d \n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and \nslightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed \n\n\n\nPage | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Compared with the Quaffle and the \nBludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \nIt was bright gold and had little fluttering silver \nwings. \n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the \nmost important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch \nbecause it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the \nSeeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out \nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get \nit before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever \nSeeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra \nhundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. \nThat\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much.

The castle felt more like home than \nPrivet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming \nmore and more interesting now that they had \nmastered the basics. \n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious \nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced \nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start \nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying \nto try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom \naround the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the \nclass into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was \nSeamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville \nhad been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was \nto be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to \ntell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. \nShe hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day \nHarry\u2019s broomstick had arrived. \n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve \nbeen practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, \nperched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish \nand flick, remember, swish and flick.

Hagrid could be seen \nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on \nthe Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin \novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \nboots. \n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry \nwould be playing in his first match after weeks of \ntraining: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor \nwon, they would move up into second place in the \nHouse Championship. \n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood \nhad decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry \nshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was \nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry \ndidn\u2019t know which was worse \u2014 people telling him \nhe\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be \nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress. \nPage | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a \nfriend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through \nall his homework without her, what with all the last- \nminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them \ndo. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, \nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read. \n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of \ncommitting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had \nhappened during a World Cup match in 1473; that \nSeekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, \nand that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to \nhappen to them; that although people rarely died \nplaying Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish \nand turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about \nbreaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her \nfrom the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for \nit. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the \nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard \nduring break, and she had conjured them up a bright \nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. \nThey were standing with their backs to it, getting \nwarm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at \nonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and \nHermione moved closer together to block the fire from \nview; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. \nUnfortunately, something about their guilty faces \ncaught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen \nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to \ntell them off anyway. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d \n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages.

For a \nsplit second, he thought he was going to fall. He \ngripped the broom tightly with both his hands and \nknees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that. \n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was \ntrying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands \ndid not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry \ntried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts \u2014 \nhe had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out \u2014 \nand then he realized that his broom was completely \nout of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t \ndirect it at all.

His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost \nimpossible for him to hang on much longer. The \nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the \nWeasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one \nof their brooms, but it was no good \u2014 every time they \ngot near him, the broom would jump higher still. They \ndropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously \nhoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the \nQuaffle and scored five times without anyone \nnoticing. \n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately. \n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand \nwhere Snape stood, and was now racing along the row \nbehind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she \nknocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in \nfront. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled \nout her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen \nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto \nthe hem of Snape \u2019s robes. \n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize \nthat he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had \ndone her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar \nin her pocket, she scrambled back along the row \u2014 \nSnape would never know what had happened. \n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able \nto clamber back on to his broom. \n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said.

Rowling \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid- \nDecember, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in \nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the \nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several \nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, \nbouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that \nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky \nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by \nHagrid before they could fly off again. \n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the \nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had \nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. \nWorst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in \nthe dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist \nbefore them and they kept as close as possible to \ntheir hot cauldrons. \n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions \nclass, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at \n\n\n\nPage | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\nHogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted \nat home.\u201d \n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and \nGoyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out \npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had \nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the \nQuidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had \nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a \nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as \nSeeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found \nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the \nway Harry had managed to stay on his bucking \nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \nback to taunting Harry about having no proper \nfamily. \n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet \nDrive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come \naround the week before, making a list of students \nwho would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had \nsigned up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at \nall; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d \never had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, \nbecause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania \nto visit Charlie. \n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, \nthey found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \nTwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a \nloud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind \nit. \n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his \nhead through the branches. \n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d \n\n\n\nPage | 218 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

The trouble was, it was very hard to \nknow where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might \nhave done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in \nGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable \nMagical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from \nImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of \nRecent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of \ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds \nof narrow rows. \n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had \ndecided to search while Ron strode off down a row of \nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at \nrandom. Harry wandered over to the Restricted \nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel \nwasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you \nneeded a specially signed note from one of the \nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he \nknew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books \ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at \nHogwarts, and only read by older students studying \nadvanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d \n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. \n\nPage | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Go on \u2014 out!\u201d \n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some \nstory, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione \nhad already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam \nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure \nshe\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk \nSnape hearing what they were up to. \n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other \ntwo had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. \nThey had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as \nthey only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t \nsurprising they\u2019d found nothing.

This \nwas exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures \nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in \nbattle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like \neverything else he owned, it had once belonged to \nsomeone else in his family \u2014 in this case, his \ngrandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a \ndrawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had \ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted. \n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had \nlent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all.

Up at the High Table, Dumbledore \nhad swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered \nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor \nFlitwick had just read him. \n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. \nPercy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle \nembedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting \nredder and redder in the face as he called for more \nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the \ncheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and \nblushed, her top hat lopsided. \n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down \nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a \npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- \nYour-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess \nset. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a \nnasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. \nNorris\u2019s Christmas dinner. \n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon \nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, \ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the \nfire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry \nbroke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to \nRon. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if \nPercy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much. \n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, \nand Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy \nto do much before bed except sit and watch Percy \nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower \nbecause they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge. \n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever.

Harry said \nnothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. \n\n\n\nPage | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, \nand thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted \nSection in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as \nhe liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel \nwas. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight \naround him as he walked. \n\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a \nlamp to see his way along the rows of books. The \nlamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and \neven though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, \nthe sight gave him the creeps. \n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the \nlibrary. Stepping carefully over the rope that \nseparated these books from the rest of the library, he \nheld up his lamp to read the titles. \n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold \nletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t \nunderstand. Some had no title at all. One book had a \ndark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The \nhairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he \nwas imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint \nwhispering was coming from the books, as though \nthey knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down \ncarefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom \nshelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black \nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out \nwith difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, \nbalancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \u2014 \nthe book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but \nthe shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, \nearsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked \nover his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he \nPage | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Wherever he \nwas, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, \ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it \nwas Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well, \nthey can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d \n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape \ncame around the corner ahead.

A door stood \najar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed \nthrough it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, \nand to his relief he managed to get inside the room \nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight \npast, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing \ndeeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That \nPage | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nhad been close, very close. It was a few seconds \nbefore he noticed anything about the room he had \nhidden in. \n\n\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes \nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and \nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket \u2014 but \npropped against the wall facing him was something \nthat didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that \nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it \nout of the way. \n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed \nfeet. There was an inscription carved around the top: \nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \n\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch \nand Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, \nwanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. \nHe stepped in front of it. \n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself \nfrom screaming. He whirled around. His heart was \npounding far more furiously than when the book had \nscreamed \u2014 for he had seen not only himself in the \nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \nbehind him. \n\nBut the room was empty.

If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their \nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air \n\u2014 she and the others existed only in the mirror. \n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair \nand her eyes \u2014 her eyes are just like mine, Harry \nthought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright \ngreen \u2014 exactly the same shape, but then he noticed \nthat she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \nto her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and \nhis hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just \nas Harry\u2019s did. \n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose \nwas nearly touching that of his reflection. \n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d \n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry \nlooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, \nand saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses \nlike his, even a little old man who looked as though \nhe had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees \u2014 Harry was looking at \nhis family, for the first time in his life. \n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared \nhungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against \nthe glass as though he was hoping to fall right \nthrough it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of \nache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The \nreflections did not fade and he looked and looked \nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses. \nHe couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to \n\nPage | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Even \nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t \ndampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that \nWood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on \nWood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against \nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the \nHouse Championship for the first time in seven years. \nQuite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he \nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after \ntraining. \n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice \nsession, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d \njust gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept \ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off \ntheir brooms. \n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s \nexactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! \nSnape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for \nany excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d \n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these \nwords. \n\n\u201c Snape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a \nmouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a \nQuidditch match?

Whenever \nHarry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an \nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling \npeople off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter. \n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the \nSorcerer\u2019s Stone.

Its spiny wings were huge \ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout \nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, \norange eyes. \n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached \nout a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at \nhis fingers, showing pointed fangs. \n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid. \n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian \nRidgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d \n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly \ndrained from his face \u2014 he leapt to his feet and ran to \nthe window. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains \n\u2014 it\u2019s a kid \u2014 he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d \n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a \ndistance there was no mistaking him. \n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon. \n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face \nduring the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione \nvery nervous. They spent most of their free time in \nHagrid \u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d \n\nPage | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Smoke kept furling out of its \nnostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping \nduties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. \nThere were empty brandy bottles and chicken \nfeathers all over the floor. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking \nat the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me \nnow, watch.

In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance \nGryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as \nthough the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. \nHow could they ever make up for this? \n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville \nsobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. \nHarry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort \nhim. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the \ndawn. What would happen when the rest of \nGryffindor found out what they\u2019d done? \n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses \nthat recorded the House points the next day thought \nthere \u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly \nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? \nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, \nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch \nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a \ncouple of other stupid first years. \n\nPage | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired \npeople at the school, Harry was suddenly the most \nhated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on \nhim, because everyone had been longing to see \nSlytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry \nwent, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their \nvoices as they insulted him.

They didn\u2019t \nhave as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as \n\nPage | 275 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. \nHermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in \nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence. \n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far \naway. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off \nhis misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to \nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to \nremember the ingredients in complicated potions, \nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates \nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to \nstart, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in \nanything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an \nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his \nown one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering \nfrom a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he \nheard Quirrell\u2019s voice. \n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 not again, please \u2014 \u201d \n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. \nHarry moved closer. \n\n\u201cAll right \u2014 all right \u2014 \u201d he heard Quirrell sob. \n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the \nclassroom straightening his turban. He was pale and \nlooked as though he was about to cry. He strode out \nof sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed \nhim. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had \ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was \nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry \nwas halfway toward it before he remembered what \nhe\u2019d promised himself about not meddling. \n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s \nStones that Snape had just left the room, and from \n\nPage | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

A little way into it \nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, \nHermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, \nNeville, and Fang took the right. \n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. \nEvery now and then a ray of moonlight through the \nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the \nfallen leaves. \n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \n\n\u201c Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry \nasked. \n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch \na unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never \nknew one ter be hurt before.\u201d \n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could \nhear running water; there must be a stream \nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn \nblood here and there along the winding path. \n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019 \nworry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019 \nthen well be able ter \u2014 GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d \n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them \noff the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an \narrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready \nto fire. The three of them listened. Something was \nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a \ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting \n\n\n\nPage | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

They walked for nearly half an \nhour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path \nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees \nwere so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be \ngetting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a \ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing \naround in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing \nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient \noak. \n\n\u201cLook \u2014 \u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop \nMalfoy. \n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. \nThey inched closer. \n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry \nhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its \nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where \nit had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on \nthe dark leaves. \n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering \nsound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on \nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the \nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the \nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and \nFang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the \nunicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the \nanimals side, and began to drink its blood. \n\n\n\nPage | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAARGH ! \u201d \n\n\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \u2014 so did \nFang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked \nright at Harry \u2014 unicorn blood was dribbling down its \nfront. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry \n\u2014 he couldn\u2019t move for fear. \n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his \nhead; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half \nblinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves \nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean \nover Harry, charging at the figure. \n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his \nknees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he \nlooked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was \nstanding over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one \nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a \npalomino body. \n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to \nhis feet. \n\n\u201cYes \u2014 thank you \u2014 what was that?\u201d \n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer.

Ronan and Bane came \nbursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and \nsweaty. \n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You \nhave a human on your back!

She \nhad to struggle because the moment she had landed, \nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils \naround her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs \nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers \nwithout their noticing. \n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the \nplant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in \nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off \nthem, but the more they strained against it, the \ntighter and faster the plant wound around them. \n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what \nthis is \u2014 it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a \ngreat help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop \nthe plant from curling around his neck. \n\n\n\nPage | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

The \npassageway sloped downward, and Harry was \nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the \n\nPage | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \n\n\n\n\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be \nguarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a \ndragon, a fully-grown dragon \u2014 Norbert had been bad \nenough ... \n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered. \n\nHarry listened.

It was full of small, jewel- \nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the \nroom. On the opposite side of the chamber was a \nheavy wooden door. \n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d \nsaid Ron. \n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, \nbut I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . \nwell, there\u2019s no other choice ...

Ron and Hermione \u2019s cheers echoed \naround the high chamber. \n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the \nkey struggling in his hand.

A foolish \nyoung man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about \ngood and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong \nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, \nand those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have \nserved him faithfully, although I have let him down \nmany times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d \nQuirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive \nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from \nGringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me \n. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on \nme. ...\u201d \n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering \nhis trip to Diagon Alley \u2014 how could he have been so \nstupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken \nhands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? \nShould I break it?\u201d \n\nPage | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the \nmirror, and opened them again. \n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. \nBut a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It \nput its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- \nred stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its \npocket \u2014 and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy \ndrop into his real pocket. Somehow \u2014 incredibly \u2014 \nhe\u2019d gotten the Stone. \n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d \nHarry screwed up his courage. \n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he \ninvented. \u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\u201d \n\nQuirrell cursed again. \n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said.

When you are older . . . \nI know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, \nyou will know.\u201d \n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d \n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing \nVoldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t \nrealize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you \nleaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to \nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person \nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection \nforever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, \ngreed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, \ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to \ntouch a person marked by something so good.\u201d \n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out \non the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his \neyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, \nHarry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 do you know \nwho sent it to me?\u201d \n\n\n\nPage | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

It seemed as though life \nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it \never was at Hogwarts. \n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than \nwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out \nmountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. \n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results \nwere still to come, but come they did. To their great \nsurprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; \nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first \nyears. Even Neville scraped through, his good \nHerbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions \none. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as \nstupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he \nhad passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you \ncouldn\u2019t have everything in life. \n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their \ntrunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking \nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all \nstudents, warning them not to use magic over the \nholidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us \nPage | 345 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

A wizened old guard was up by the ticket \nbarrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and \nthrees so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting \nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \n\u201cboth of you \u2014 I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look \nforward to.\u201d \n\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the \ngateway back to the Muggle world.
